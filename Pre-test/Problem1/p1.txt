Problem 1 of "Starter Problems 1" from orac.amt.edu.au

Addition
Input File: addin.txt
Output File: addout.txt
Time Limit: 1 second

Your task here is a straight-forward one: you are to write a program that takes two numbers and adds them together. Luckily, computers are built for adding numbers together and will do all the calculation for you - all you need to do is write code that will correctly read from and write to the text files.

Input:
The input file will consist of the two integers a and b separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that 0 <= a, b <= 1,000,000,000.

Output:
Your output file should consist of a single integer, the sum of a and b.

Sample Input:
23 45

Sample Output:
68

Scoring:
The score for each input file will be 100% if the correct answer is written to the output file and 0% otherwise.

Submissions:
Please place your Python3 file inside the same directory as this txt file. Failure to do so will result in a zero score for this problem.
