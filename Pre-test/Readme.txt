Hi Ed,

The problems here will be focused around past competition papers which become progressively harder as you solve more and more problems.
They require on reading txt files and processing their content for output in a separate txt file.
I would actually be very surprised if you could solve them all!

Overview:

1 - Addition (Almost trivial)
2 - Sitting or Standing? (May catch you)
3 - NORT (Pretty easy)
4 - Magic Squares (May catch you)
5 - Mouse Hunt (Difficult)
6 - Keeping Secrets (Very difficult)

Submissions will be assessed on Monday next week.

Good luck!
