# -P-Repository

Hi there,

Welcome to my repository where I help you with python.

Every week I will release new modules and challenge problems for you to solve.

For the first Week, I will give you a pre-test which will not go towards your weighting. It is simply there to see how experienced you are with Python3. For this test, I recommend that you do your best as it determines which modules you will skip - meaning that you will have to spend less time learning, and more time elsewhere (whatever you do, that is...)

Good luck and have fun!
